# Formulas

This directory contains various sets of LTL formulas. The directory `literature` contains formulas (or instantiations families) that have been published in the literature. The following sets exist:

* `base.ltl` contains simple combinations of modal operators and boolean connectives to test basic functionality of a translation.
* `regressions.ltl` contains formulas that at some point in the past triggered a bug in a translation.
* `bugs.ltl` contains formulas who currently trigger bugs, but it is unclear what the reason is and further investigation is required.
* `check.ltl` and others contain unattributed formulas that need to be sorted.
