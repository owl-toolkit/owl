# 2019.06.01

Modules:

* Fixed a small soundness bug in the ltl2n{a,ba,gba} modules. Thanks to Alexandre Duret-Lutz for
  reporting this issue.

# 2019.06

Modules:

* Implemented all LICS'18 translations for LTL fragments. Including a symbolic
  successor / edge computation. The translations can be found in the canonical
  package and are exposed via `ltl2da` and `ltl2na`.

* Removed TLSF support. Ensuring the correct implementation of the TLSF
  specification posed a too large maintenance burden. Users of the TLSF format
  can use Syfco (https://github.com/reactive-systems/syfco) to translate it to
  a basic LTL formula.

  _Warning_: There are several specifications from Syntcomp in the TLSF (basic)
  format that have not been correctly parsed if they have not been properly
  parenthesised before.

* Renamed minimize-aut to optimize-aut to highlight that automata are not
  necessarily _minimal_. Implemented optimizations for Büchi-like Rabin pairs.

* Removed unmaintained and broken `safra` module.

API:

* Overhaul of the symbolic successor computation

  In addition to providing a mapping from `Edge<S>` to `ValuationSet` (renamed
  from `labelledEdges(S state)` to `edgeMap(S state)`) some automata can provide
  a direct computation of a decision tree mapping from valuations to sets of
  edges (`edgeTree(S state)`). This enable optimisation in the JNI-access.

  This feature is mostly used by the direct translation of the safety and
  co-safety fragment of LTL to deterministic automata.

* EquivalenceClass offers a `trueness` value giving the percentage of satisfying
  assignments for an EquivalenceClass. This value is exposed via the JNI as the
  quality score.

* Redesigned Formula classes offering substitution as part of the API instead
  of a separate visitor.

* `{M,R,U,W}Operator.of(...)` added the following simplification rules:
  1. (x M y) M y -> x M y
  2. (x R y) R y -> x R y
  3. x U (x U y) -> x U y
  4. x W (x W y) -> x W y

* The LTL simplifier added the following simplification rules:
  1. x M (!x | y) and y is pure universal -> F x & G (!x | y)
  2. x R (!x | y) and y is pure universal -> G (!x | y)
  3. x U (!x & y) and y is pure eventual -> F (!x & y)
  4. x W (!x & y) and y is pure eventual -> G x | F (!x & y)
  5. F a & a R b -> a M b
  6. F a & b W a -> b U a
  7. G a | a U b -> a W b
  8. G a | b M a -> b R a

* Overhaul of the C++-API. Most notably there is an API for approximative
  realisability checks for a state in the decomposed DPA.

* Add basic support for ultimately periodic words and add language membership
  tests.

Bugfixes:

* Throw an exception on malformed LTL input such as `FF`, `Fa!` and `F+`. Thanks
  to Alexandre Duret-Lutz for reporting this issue.

* The `hoa` module now correctly parsed the `-s` and `--state-acceptance`
  options.


# 2018.06

TBD (see gitlog)

# 1.2-SNAPSHOT

Library:

 * Support the `xor` operator in the LTL input.

# 1.1 (2017-03-28)

Tools:

 * `fgx2dga` (Preview): A translation of LTL-fairness formulas (`FG`/`GF`) to deterministic automata with a generic acceptance condition, meaning the acceptance condition is an arbitrary boolean combination of `Inf` and `Fin` sets. The tool supports all LTL operators using a fallback mechanism. This is a preview, thus functionality as well as the name is subject to change.

Library:

 * Extended simplifier for Fairness Formulas
 * Redesigned automaton classes.
 * Implement an emptiness check for a given SCC.

# 1.0 (2017-02-03)

Tools:

 * `ltl2ldba`: A translator of LTL to limit-deterministic Büchi automata.
 * `ltl2dpa`: A translator of LTL to deterministic parity automata via LDBAs.
 * `ltl2da`: A translator of LTL to any deterministic automata. The tool is a wrapper for the before mentioned tools and returns the smallest automaton.
 * `nba2ldba`: A translator of non-deterministic Büchi to limit-deterministic Büchi automata.
