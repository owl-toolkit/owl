For benchmarking purposes several scripts have been created in scripts/benchmarking that can generate ltl formulas as well NBAs and run the benchmarks.
The generated ltl formulas and automatons have been put into the corresponding folders in data.
The benchmarking result are saved in the folder benchmarking-results.

The following translations are supported.
LTL -> LDBA (Breakpoint) -> DPA
LTL -> LDBA (Breakpointfree) -> DPA
LTL -> NBA (via ltl2tgba) -> LDBA -> DPA
LTL -> DRA -> DPA
LTL -> (via ltl2tgba) DPA
LTL -> LDBA (Breakpoint) -> (via autfilt) DPA
LTL -> LDBA (Breakpointfree) -> (via autfilt) DPA

NBA -> LDBA -> DPA
NBA -> (via autfilt) DPA
NBA -> LDBA -> (via autfilt) DPA

Currently ltl formulas are available from randltl, genltl and syntcomp.
NBAs can are available from tandaut and genaut.

Example usage:
Generate Ltl formulas from genltl:
./scripts/benchmarking/generateGenLtlFormulas > data/formulas/genltl.ltl

Running benchmarks for ltl formulas:
./scripts/benchmarking/runBenchmarksLtl
