A Java library for **O**mega-**w**ords, Ï‰-automata and **L**inear Temporal Logic (LTL). Batteries included. 
For further information see the official [website](https://owl.model.in.tum.de/).

It ships basic building blocks for constructing omega-automata and includes several command-line tools implementing these translations.
For details on how to use and integrate with `Owl`, see the [usage instructions](doc/USAGE.md). This is sufficient for users working with `Owl`.
